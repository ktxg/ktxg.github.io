I am Katie and I am learning how to make websites _with interactive graphics_! 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(viridis)
library(p8105.datasets)

library(plotly)
```

## Let's make some plots

```{r}
data("nyc_airbnb")
## we can see 'nyc_airbnb' in the environment tab now 
```



```{r}
set.seed(1)

data(nyc_airbnb)
nyc_airbnb = 
  nyc_airbnb %>% 
  mutate(rating = review_scores_location / 2) %>%
  select(
    neighbourhood_group, neighbourhood, rating, price, room_type, lat, long) %>%
  filter(
    !is.na(rating), 
    neighbourhood_group == "Manhattan",
    room_type == "Entire home/apt",
    price %in% 100:500)  %>% 
  sample_n(5000)

## this makes the dataset more manageable 
```

```{r}

```
